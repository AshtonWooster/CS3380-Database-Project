Hello, this is my CS3380 final project.
The purpose of this website is to allow for easy management of SIGs and their attendance.

To start up local website and database enter this command into your terminal:
The optional parameter "y", will populate the database with default data
```bash
$ ./init.bash (y)
```
The website will then be open at `http://localhost:3000`

This file installs dependences, compiles the .jsx files, and starts the database and local webserver.
